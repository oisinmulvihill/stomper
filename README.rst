Introduction
------------

This is a python client implementation of the STOMP protocol.

The client is attempting to be transport layer neutral. This module provides
functions to create and parse STOMP messages in a programmatic fashion. The
messages can be easily generated and parsed, however its up to the user to do
the sending and receiving.

I've looked at the stomp client by Jason R. Briggs. I've based some of the
'function to message' generation on how his client does it. The client can
be found at the follow address however it isn't a dependency.

- `stompy <http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/projects/stomppy>`_

In testing this library I run against ActiveMQ project. The server runs
in java, however its fairly standalone and easy to set up. The projects
page is here:

- `ActiveMQ <http://activemq.apache.org/>`_


Source Code
-----------

The code can be accessed via git on github. Further details can be found here:

- `Stomper <https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper>`_


Examples
--------

Basic Usage
~~~~~~~~~~~

To see some basic code usage example see ``example/stomper_usage.py``. The unit test
``tests/teststomper.py`` illustrates how to use all aspects of the code.


Receive/Sender
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The example ``receiver.py`` and ``sender.py`` show how messages and generated and then
transmitted using the twisted framework. Other frameworks could be used instead. The
examples also demonstrate the state machine I used to determine a response to received
messages.

I've also included ``stompbuffer-rx.py``  and ``stompbuffer-tx.py`` as examples of using
the new stompbuffer module contributed by Ricky Iacovou.


Release Process
---------------

Submit a pull request with tests if possible. I'll review and submit. All tests
must pass. I tend to run against python 3.10+ nowadays. I will then increment the
version, add attribute and then release to pypi if all is good.

Help Oisin remember the relase process::

  # clean env for release:
  mkvirtualenv --clear -p python3 stomper

  # setup and run all tests:
  python setup.py develop
  python setup.py test

  # Build and release to test.pypi.org first:
  pip install twine
  python setup.py sdist bdist_wheel
  twine upload --repository-url https://test.pypi.org/legacy/ dist/*

  # On success
  twine upload dist/*

  # Commit any changes and tag the release
  git tag X.Y.Z


Supported STOMP Versions
------------------------

1.1
~~~

This is the default version of the of STOMP used in stomper versions 0.3.x.

* https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.1.html

1.0
~~~

This is no longer the default protocol version. To use it you can import it as
follows::

    import stomper.stomp_10 as stomper

This is the default version used in stomper version 0.2.x.

* https://stomp.github.io/stomp-specification-1.0.html


Version History
---------------

0.4.3
~~~~~

- Thanks to Petr Viktorin (https://github.com/encukou) for removing deprecated
unittest methods.
- I (OM) am just updating the release process to use Github actions to manage
the test, build and release process.

0.4.2
~~~~~

Thanks to https://github.com/pgajdos for contributing a fix to include the
license in the distribution. OM: Added minor fix to support test.pypi.org
uploading before releasing. Document my release process to help me next time
around.

0.4.1
~~~~~

Thanks to Ralph Bean (https://github.com/ralphbean) contributing a fix to setup.py and utf-8 encoding under python3.

0.4.0
~~~~~

Thanks to Lumír 'Frenzy' Balhar (https://github.com/frenzymadness) contributing
python3 support.

0.3.0
~~~~~

This release makes STOMP v1.1 the default protocol. To stick with STOMP v1.0
you can continue to use stomper v0.2.9 or change the import in your code to::

    import stomper.stomp_10 as stomper

**Note** Any fixes to STOMP v1.0 will only be applied to version >= 0.3.

0.2.9
~~~~~

Thanks to Ralph Bean for contributing the new protocol 1.1 support:

 * https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper/issues/6
 * https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper/pull/7

0.2.8
~~~~~

Thanks to Daniele Varrazzo for contributing the fixes:

https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper/pull/4
 * Fixed newline prepended to messages without transaction id

https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper/pull/5
 * Fixed reST syntax. Extension changed to allow github to render it properly.
   Also changed the source url in the readme.


0.2.7
~~~~~

I forgot to add a MANIFEST.in which makes sure README.md is present. Without
this pip install fails: https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper/issues/3.
Thanks to Ian Weller for noticing this. I've also added in the fix suggested
by Arfrever https://github.com/oisinmulvihill/stomper/issues/1.


0.2.6
~~~~~

Add contributed fixes from Simon Chopin. He corrected many spelling mistakes
throughout the code base. I've also made the README.md the main

0.2.5
~~~~~

Add the contributed fix for issue #14 by Niki Pore. The issue was reported by
Roger Hoover. This removes the extra line ending which can cause problems.


0.2.4
~~~~~

OM: A minor release fixing the problem whereby uuid would be installed on python2.5+. It
is not needed after python2.4 as it comes with python. Arfrever Frehtes Taifersar Arahesis
contributed the fix for this.


0.2.3
~~~~~

OM: I've fixed  issue #9  with the example code. All messages are sent and received correctly.


0.2.2
~~~~~

- Applied patch from esteve.fernandez to resolve "Issue 4: First Message not received" in the
  example code (http://code.google.com/p/stomper/issues/detail?id=4&can=1).

- I've (Oisin) updated the examples to use twisted's line receiver and got it to "detect"
  complete stomp messages. The old example would not work if a large amount of data was streamed.
  In this case dataReceived would be called with all the chunks of a message. This means that it
  would not be correct for it to attempt to unpack and react until the whole message has been
  received. Using twisted's line receiver looking for the \x00 works like a charm for this.


This release integrates the bug fixes and the optional stompbuffer contributed by Ricky
Iacovou:

- Removed the trailing '\n\n' inserted by Frame.pack(). I believe that adding this is
  incorrect, for the following reasons:

http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol gives the example::

	CONNECT
	login: <username>
	passcode:<passcode>

	^@

and comments, "the body is empty in this case". This gives the impression that the body
is *exactly* defined as "the bytes, if any, between the '\n\n' at the end of the header
and the null byte".

This works for both binary and ASCII payloads: if I want to send a string without a
newline, I should be able to, in which case the body should look like::

	this is a string without a newline^@

... and the receiver should deal with this.

This impression is reinforced by the fact that ActiveMQ will complain if you supply a
content-length header with any other byte count than that described above.

I am also unsure about the newline after the null byte as nothing in the protocol says
that there should be a newline after the null byte. Much of the code in StompBuffer
actively expects it to be there, but I suspect that *relying* on a frame ending '\x00\n'
may well limit compatibility. It's not an issue with Stomper-to-Stomper communication,
of course, as the sender puts it, the receiver accepts it, and ActiveMQ happily sends
it along.

- StompBuffer has had a few fixes; most notably, a fix that prevents a content-length "header"
  in the *body* from being picked up and used (!). The biggest change is a new method,
  syncBuffer(), which allows a corrupted buffer to recover from the corruption. Note that
  I've never actually *seen* the buffer corruption when using Twisted, but the thought
  occurred to me that a single corrupt buffer could hang the entire message handling process.

- Fixed the typo "NO_REPONSE_NEEDED". I've changed it to NO_RESPONSE_NEEDED, but kept the
  old variable for backwards compatibility;

- I've also modified the string format in send() to include the '\n\n' between the header
  and the body, which I think is missing (it currently has only one '\n').

- Added CONNECTED to VALID_COMMANDS so syncBuffer() does not decide these messages are bogus.

- Added new unit test file teststompbuffer which covers the new functionality.
