"""
This is a python client implementation of the STOMP protocol.

It aims to be transport layer neutral. This module provides functions to
create and parse STOMP messages in a programmatic fashion.

The examples package contains two examples using twisted as the transport
framework. Other frameworks can be used and I may add other examples as
time goes on.

The STOMP protocol specification maybe found here:

 * http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol

I've looked at the stomp client by Jason R. Briggs and have based the message
generation on how his client does it. The client can be found at the follow
address however it isn't a dependancy.

 * http://www.briggs.net.nz/log/projects/stomppy

In testing this library I run against ActiveMQ project. The server runs
in java, however its fairly standalone and easy to set up. The projects
page is here:

 * http://activemq.apache.org/
